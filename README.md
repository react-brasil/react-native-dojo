A remote Dojo to learn React Native and the most recent technologies,
[read more here](https://github.com/react-native-dojo/react-native-dojo/issues/1).

Everything started with this meetup: [React Native Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sao-Paulo-React-React-Native-Meetup/)

## But what is a Dojo?
It's a collaborative approach to learn to code.

## What we intend to learn:
- React
- React Native
- Redux / Flux
- GraphQL / Falcor
- Relay
- ES6/ES7
- Webpack
- Babel
- NPM
- Testing
- ESLint
- Flow
- ...

This [issue](https://github.com/react-native-dojo/react-native-dojo/issues/1) will be used to debate and detail ideas.
